Unintrusive mind calm application

## About

Mind Peace is the meditation app that allows you to meditate without stumbling in your way.

Just hit play and start meditating


## Technique

To use Mind Peace, simply go to the website (or, if you are here, deploy your own version) and hit play. Alternatively you can change the total duration of the meditation session.

As soon as the session start, you will hear a relaxing rain music and a gong sound when every phase finish.

Just close your eyes, enjoy the sound and follow each phase:

1. Settle in. Feel the weight of your body against the chair, the coach or the floor.
2. Deep Breath. Breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. Let flow any thinking.
3. Let your breath return to its natural flow. 
4. Get back to your space.
5. Open your eyes.


Though this is a suggested approach, you can really use each phase as you want.
